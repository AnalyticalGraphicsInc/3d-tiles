        "description": "A template URI pointing to binary files containing node availability for subtrees. A node availability file exists for each subtree that exists. The URI of each availability file is substituted with the subtree's global level, x, y, and z (`OCTREE` only). The file header is two bits indicating whether the subtree is fully available or unavailable. The first bit indicates full availability while the second is for unavailability. They both cannot be 1. If either is 1, then there is no availability bitstream, only `virtual` leaf information. The availability bitstream is a 1D boolean array where nodes are ordered by their level in the subtree and Morton index within that level and conforms to the boolean array encoding described in the Cesium 3D Metadata specification: https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/blob/3d-tiles-next/specification/Metadata/0.0.0/README.md. A node's availability is determined by a single bit, 1 meaning a node exists at that spatial index, and 0 meaning it does not. For each leaf in the subtree, there are N+1 bits, where N is 4 or 8 for `QUADTREE` or `OCTREE`. The extra N bits tell for each child of the `virtual` leaf of the subtree, whether the subtree rooted at that child is available. The number of bits (for non-fully available or unavailable subtrees) is `(N ^ (subtreeDepth + 1) - 1) / (N - 1)+N ^(subtreeDepth + 2)+2` where N is 4 for `QUADTREE` and 8 for `OCTREE`."
