# Cesium 3D Metadata Specification

The Cesium 3D Metadata Specification defines a standard metadata format for 3D data.

For usage see:

* [`3DTILES_metadata`](../../../extensions/3DTILES_metadata/1.0.0) - 3D Tiles extension that assigns metadata to various components of 3D Tiles
* [`EXT_feature_metadata`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_feature_metadata/1.0.0) - glTF extension that assigns metadata to features in a model on a per-vertex, per-texel, or per-instance basis

See the [Cesium Metadata Semantic Reference](Semantics) for built-in semantics for 3D Tiles and glTF.
